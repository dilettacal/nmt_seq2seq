I would therefore speak for quality rather than mobility .
Above all - and this is very critical for us - there is no significant extension of codecision between the european parliament and the council of ministers .
This will make the process of amending its technical annexes more transparent .
It is reasonable for Europe to issue European public debt , although Mrs Merkel does not approve .
I hope i will be back .
